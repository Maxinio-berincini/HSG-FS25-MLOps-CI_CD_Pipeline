    "# 3 - AlexNet\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be implementing a modified version of [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf), a neural network model that uses convolutional neural network (CNN) layers and was designed for the [ImageNet challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/). AlexNet is famous for winning the ImageNet challenge in 2012 by beating the second place competitor by over 10% accuracy and kickstarting the interest in deep learning for computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows the architecture of AlexNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/alexnet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusingly, there are two \"paths\" of processing through the network. This is due to the original AlexNet model being implemented on two GPUs in parallel. Almost all implementations of AlexNet are now on a single GPU and our implementation is too.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now moving on from the MNIST dataset and from now on we will be using the [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. CIFAR10 consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-image-classification/blob/master/assets/cifar10.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also show how to initialize the weights of our neural network and how to find a suitable learning rate using a modified version of the [learning rate finder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186).\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the previous notebooks we'll implement our model, measure its performance on the dataset, and then have a short look into seeing what the model has learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of this notebook will be similar to the previous ones thus we will skim over code that has been shown before. We can look at the previous notebook for a refresher if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, we'll import the modules we need. A new import is the `_LRScheduler` which we will use to implement our learning rate finder."

    "### Defining the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up is defining the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual model itself is no more difficult to understand than the previous model, LeNet. It is made up of convolutional layers, pooling layers and ReLU activation functions. See the previous notebook for a refresher on these concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are only two new concepts introduced here, `nn.Sequential` and `nn.Dropout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of `Sequential` as like our transforms introduced earlier for data augmentation. We provide `Sequential` with multiple layers and when the `Sequential` module is called it will apply each layer, in order, to the input. There is no difference between using a `Sequential` and having each module defined in the `__init__` and then called in `forward` - however it makes the code significantly shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have one `Sequential` model, `features`, for all the convolutional and pooling layers, then we flatten then data and pass it to the `classifier`, another `Sequential` model which is made up of linear layers and the second new concept, *dropout*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is a form of [*regularization*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)). As our models get larger, to perform more accurately on richer datasets, they start having a significantly higher number of parameters. The problem with lots of parameters is that our models begin to *overfit*. That is, they do not learn general image features whilst learning to classify images but instead simply memorize images within the training set. This is bad as it will cause our model to achieve poor performance on the validation/testing set. To solve this overfitting problem, we use regularization. Dropout is just one method of regularization, other common ones are *L1 regularization*, *L2 regularization* and *weight decay*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout works by randomly setting a certain fraction, 0.5 here, of the neurons in a layer to zero. This effectively adds noise to the training of the neural network and causes neurons to learn with \"less\" data as they are only getting half of the information from a previous layer with dropout applied. It can also be thought of as causing your model to learn multiple smaller models with less parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is only applied when the model is training. It needs to be \"turned off\" when validating, testing or using the model for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous notebook, during the convolutional and pooling layers the activation function should be placed **after** the pooling layer to reduce computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the linear layers, dropout should be applied **after** the activation function. Although when using ReLU activation functions the same result is achieved if dropout is before or after, see [here](https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/dropout-activation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing to mention is that the very first convolutional layer has an `in_channel` of three. That is because we are handling color images that have three channels (red, green and blue) instead of the single channel grayscale images from the MNIST dataset. This doesn't change the way any of the convolutional filter works, it just means the first filter has a depth of three instead of a depth of one."

    "\n",
    "PyTorch's default initialization is usually fine however by manually trying different initialization schemes we can usually squeeze out a slight performance improvement.\n",

    "We initialize parameters in PyTorch by creating a function that takes in a PyTorch module, checking what type of module it is, and then using the `nn.init` methods to actually initialize the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our convolutional layers, we'll initialize the weights from a Normal distribution with a standard deviation given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\text{gain}}{\\sqrt{\\text{fan mode}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of $\\text{gain}$ depends on the non-linearity we will be using after the convolutional layer and we simply tell the initialization function that we are using ReLU which sets the gain to $\\sqrt{2}$. The fan mode can be either `fan_in` or `fan_out`. `fan_in` is the number of connections coming into the layer and `fan_out` is the number of connections going out of the layer. For the first convolutional layer the input is from 3x3x3 filter, so the `fan_in` is 27 and the output is 64x3x3,  so the `fan_out` is 576. We leave it to the default `fan_in` mode. This initialization scheme is called *Kaiming Normal*, also known as *He Normal*. See the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852) to learn more about how it was devised.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the linear layers we initialize with a Normal distribution but this time the standard deviation is given by:\n",

    "$$\\text{gain} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\text{fan_in} + \\text{fan_out}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusingly, instead of just telling the initialization function which non-linearity we want to use and have it calculate the gain for us, we have to tell it what gain we want to use. Luckily, `nn.init` has a `calculate_gain` function which does that for us, and we just tell it we are using ReLUs. This type of initialize scheme is called *Xavier Normal*, also known as *Glorot Normal*. See the [paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf) for the theory behind it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For both types of layer we initialize the bias terms to zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we even need to initialize our parameters this way? See [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/weight-initialization-in-neural-networks-a-journey-from-the-basics-to-kaiming-954fb9b47c79) article for a great explanation, but the gist of it is that just like how we normalized our input data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, we also want the outputs of each activation function (and therefore the inputs to the subsequent layer) to also have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. These initialization schemes, by taking account the number of connections in to and out of a layer as well as the non-linearity used, help achieve this normalization effect when initializing weights."

    "Next up is the learning rate finder. The code here is taken from a stripped down and slightly modified version of the excellent [pytorch-lr-finder](https://github.com/davidtvs/pytorch-lr-finder). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: the learning rate finder is more of an art than a science. It is not going to find an exact learning rate to 10 decimal places which will always give us 100% accuracy - but it is usually going to be better than just picking a learning rate out of thin air.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used optimizer used is Adam. Adam's default learning rate is usually a fine choice but, much like how we manually initialized our parameters to potentially get some performance improvement, we can try and calculate an optimal learning rate manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the learning rate finder work? We give the finder our model, optimizer and criterion we want to use. However we give it an optimizer with a much lower learning rate than we are expecting to use. We then train the model on the batches of data from the training set - calculating the loss and updating the parameters. After each batch we increase the learning rate exponentially from the initial, extremely low learning rate to a learning rate we know will be too high. This repeats until our loss diverges (over 5x the best loss achieved) or we reach our defined maximum learning rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "At each batch we are recording the learning rate and the loss achieved on that batch. By plotting them against each other we can find a suitable learning rate - but more on how to do that in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The losses calculated are usually quite noisy so we actually save the exponentially weighted average of the loss calculated. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also want to use our initialized parameters, not the ones obtained by upgrading the parameters when performing the learning rate finder. Hence we save the model parameters to disk when initializing the finder and then they are reset to our desired initialized ones just before the `range_test` function returns by loading the initial values from disk."

This pre-trained version of AlexNet was trained by people at PyTorch and was not trained on the CIFAR10 dataset, but on the [ILSVRC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575) dataset, usually just called the ImageNet dataset. ImageNet is a dataset with over 1 million images in 1,000 classes.
